# Exploratory Data Analysis on Car Dataset

## Project Overview
This project performs an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a car dataset. It covers data cleaning, handling missing values, outlier detection, feature engineering, and visualizations to prepare a structured dataset for machine learning models.

## Features
- Data inspection and summary statistics
- Handling missing values and duplicates
- Outlier detection and treatment
- Feature engineering and encoding
- Correlation analysis and heatmaps
- Interactive data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Final cleaned dataset ready for ML models

## Tools and Libraries
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## Results
- Cleaned and structured dataset with no missing values
- Visual insights about car prices, mileage, brand distribution, and fuel types
- Outlier handling improved dataset consistency
- Dataset is now ML-ready
